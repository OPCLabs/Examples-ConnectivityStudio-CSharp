This directory contains examples in C# for 
* OPC client development, 
* OPC server,
* OPC subscriber development,
* Sparkplug host application development, and
* Sparkplug edge node development.

The examples for OPC cover OPC Data Access (OPC DA), OPC Alarms&Events (OPC A&E), OPC XML, and OPC Unified Architecture 
(OPC UA) specifications, including OPC UA PubSub. They are supported on Microsoft Windows and Linux. The OPC client and 
subscriber examples work with our sample servers and publishers. Most of them reside on the Web; OPC "Classic" servers for 
Windows are installed using the [Connectivity Studio Setup program](https://www.opclabs.com/download).
